          <h3>O Come to the Altar</h3>
          Are you hurting and broken within?
          Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
          Jesus is calling.
          Have you come to the end of yourself?
          Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
          Jesus is calling.
          <em>x2</em>
          
          O come to, the altar,
          the Father's arms are open wide,
          forgiveness, was bought with,
          the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
          
          Leave behind your regrets and mistakes,
          come today there’s no reason to wait,
          Jesus is calling.
          Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy,
          from the ashes a new life is born,
          Jesus is calling.
          
          O come to, the altar,
          the Father's arms are open wide,
          forgiveness, was bought with,
          the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
          
          Oh what a Saviour,
          isn't He wonderful,
          sing hallelujah Christ is risen,
          bow down before Him,
          for He is Lord of all,
          sing hallelujah Christ is risen.
          <em>x2</em>
          
          O come to, the altar,
          the Father's arms are open wide,
          forgiveness, was bought with,
          the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
          
          Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
          Tell the world of the treasure you found

           <h3>All Sufficient Merit</h3>
           All sufficient merit, shining like the sun
           A fortune I inherent by no work I have done
           My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior's cross
           Where all sufficient merit did what I could not
           
           In love He condescended, eternal now in time
           A life without a blemish, the Maker made to die
           The law could never save us, our lawlessness had won
           Until the pure and spotless Lamb had finally come
           
           It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
           Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own
           
           I lay down my garments, any empty boast
           Good works, now all corrupted by the sinful host
           I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus, a crimson robe made white
           No more fear of judgement, His righteousness is mine
           
           It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
           Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own
           <em>x2</em>
           
           All sufficient merit, firm in life and death
           The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
           When I stand accepted before the throne of God
           I'll gaze upon my Jesus, and thank Him for the cross
           Yes we thank you for the cross
           
           It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
           Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own
           
           All sufficient merit, firm in life and death
           The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath

            <h3>Jireh</h3>
              I'll never be more loved than I am right now
              Wasn't holding You up
              So there's nothing I can do to let You down
              It doesn't take a trophy to make You proud
              I'll never be more loved than I am right now
            
              Going through a storm but I won't go down
              I hear Your voice
              Carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out
            
              You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
              I’ll never be more loved than I am right now
            
              You are Jireh, You are enough
              Jireh, You are enough
              And I will be content in every circumstance
              You are Jireh, You are enough
            
              Forever enough
              Always enough
              More than enough
              Forever enough
              Always enough
              More than enough
            
              I don't wanna forget
              How I feel right now
              On the mountaintop
              I can see so clear what it's all about
            
              So stay by my side when the sun goes down
              Don't wanna forget how I feel right now
            
              You are Jireh, You are enough
              Jireh, You are enough
              And I will be content in every circumstance
              You are Jireh, You are enough
            
              Forever enough
              Always enough
              More than enough
              Forever enough
              Always enough
              More than enough
            
              If he dresses the lilies
              With beauty and splendor
              How much more will he clothe you?
              How much more will he clothe you?
              If he watches over every sparrow
              How much more does he Love you?
              How much more
              <em>x2</em>
            
              You are Jireh, You are enough
              Jireh, You are enough
              And I will be content in every circumstance
              You are Jireh, You are enough

              Here I am
              Down on my knees again
              Surrendering all
              Surrendering all
              
              Find me here
              Lord as You draw me near
              Desperate for You
              Desperate for You

              Drench my soul
              As mercy and grace unfold
              I hunger and thirst
              I hunger and thirst
              
              With arms stretched wide
              I know You hear my cry
              Speak to me now
              Speak to me now

              I want to know You more
              
              Like a rushing wind
              Jesus breathe within
              Lord have your way
              Lord have your way in me
              
              Like a mighty storm
              Stir within my soul
