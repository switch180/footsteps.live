        <h3>Heart of Worship</h3>
          When the music fades all is stripped away
        and I simply come
        Longing just to bring something that's of
        worth that will bless your heart

        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within
        through the way things appear
        you're looking into my heart

        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus

        King of endless worth no one could express
        how much you deserve
        Though I'm weak and poor all I have is
        yours, every single breath

        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within

        you're looking into my heart

        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and

        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus

        Man of sorrows Lamb of God
        By His own betrayed
        The sin of man and wrath of God
        Has been on Jesus laid

        Silent as He stood accused
        Beaten mocked and scorned
        Bowing to the Father's will
        He took a crown of thorns

        Oh that rugged cross
        My salvation
        Where Your love poured out over me
        Now my soul cries out
        Hallelujah
        Praise and honour unto Thee

        Sent of heaven God's own Son
        To purchase and redeem
        And reconcile the very ones
        Who nailed Him to that tree

        Oh that rugged cross
        My salvation
        Where Your love poured out over me
        Now my soul cries out

        Now my debt is paid
        It is paid in full
        By the precious blood
        That my Jesus spilled

        Now the curse of sin
        Has no hold on me
        Whom the Son sets free
        O is free indeed

        Oh that rugged cross
        My salvation

        My salvation
        Where Your love poured out over me

        <h3>The First Noel</h3>
        The first Noel the angels did say
        Was to certain poor
        Shepherds in fields as they lay:
        In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
        On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

        Noel Noel, Noel Noel
        Born is the King of Israel.

        They looked up and saw a star
        Shining in the east beyond them far:
        And to the earth it gave great light
        And so it continued both day and night.

        Noel Noel, Noel Noel
        Born is the King of Israel.

        This star drew nigh to the north-west;
        O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest,
        And there it did both stop and stay,
        Right over the place where Jesus lay.

        Noel Noel, Noel Noel
        Born is the King of Israel.

        Then entered in those wise men three,
        Fell reverently upon their knee,
        And offered there in his presence
        Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

        Noel Noel, Noel Noel
        Born is the King of Israel.

        Then let us all with one accord
        Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
        That hath made heav'n and earth of nought,
        And with his blood mankind has bought.
