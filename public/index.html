        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        All my words fall short
        I got nothing new
        How could I express
        All my gratitude
        
        I could sing these songs
        As I often do
        But every song must end
        And You never do
        
        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much
        But I've nothing else fit for a King
        Except for a heart singing
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        
        I've got one response
        I've got just one move
        With my arms stretched wide
        I will worship You
        
        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much
        But I've nothing else fit for a King
        Except for a heart singing
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        
        So come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
        Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a
        lion inside of those lungs
        Get up and praise the Lord
        <em>x3</em>
        
        So I throw up my hands
        Praise You again and again

        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much

        <h3>What A Beautiful Name</h3>
          You were the Word at the beginning
        One With God the Lord Most High
        Your hidden glory in creation
        Now revealed in You Our Christ

        You didn't want heaven without us
        So Jesus You brought heaven down
        My sin was great, Your love was greater
        What could separate us now
        
        What a wonderful Name it is,

        Death could not hold you, The veil tore before You
        You silenced the boast of sin and grave
        The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
        For you are raised to life again
        
        You have no rival, You have no equal
        Now and forever God You reign
        Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
        Yours is the Name above all names
        
        What a powerful Name it is,
        What a powerful Name it is
        The Name of Jesus Christ my King
        What a powerful Name it is,
        Nothing can stand against

        <h3>Living Hope</h3>
        How great the chasm that lay between us
        How high the mountain I could not climb
        In desperation, I turned to heaven
        And spoke Your name into the night
        
        Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
        Tore through the shadows of my soul

        Who could imagine so great a mercy?
        What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
        The God of ages stepped down from glory
        To wear my sin and bear my shame
        
        The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
        The King of kings calls me His own
        Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        
        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain

          Where grace is found is where You are
          And where You are Lord I am free
          Holiness is Christ in me
          
          Lord, I need You, oh I need You
          Every hour I need You
          My one defense, my righteousness
          Oh God, how I need You
          
          So teach my song to rise to You
          When temptation comes my way
          And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
          Jesus You're my hope and stay
          Jesus You're my hope and stay
          <em>x2</em>
          
          Lord, I need You, oh I need You
          Every hour I need You
          My one defense, my righteousness
          Oh God, how I need You
          Lord, I need You, oh I need You
          Every hour I need You
          My one defense, my righteousness
          Oh God, how I need You
          
          My one defense, my righteousness
          Oh God, how I need You
          My one defense, my righteousness
          Oh God, how I need You
