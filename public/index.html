        All my words fall short
        I got nothing new
        How could I express
        All my gratitude

        I could sing these songs
        As I often do
        But every song must end
        And You never do

        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much
        But I've nothing else fit for a King
        Except for a heart singing
        Hallelujah, hallelu - jah

        I've got one response
        I've got just one move
        With my arms stretched wide
        I will worship You

        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much

        Except for a heart singing
        Hallelujah, hallelu - jah

        So come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
        Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a
        lion inside of those lungs
        Get up and praise the Lord
        <em>x3</em>

        So I throw up my hands
        Praise You again and again

        I cast my mind to Calvary
        Where Jesus bled and died for me
        I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
        My Saviour on that cursed tree

        His body bound and drenched in tears
        They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
        The entrance sealed by heavy stone
        Messiah still and all alone

        O praise His name forevermore
        For endless days we will sing Your praise
        Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

        And then on the third at break of dawn
        The Son of heaven rose again
        O trampled death where is your sting?
        The angels roar for Christ the King

        O praise the name of the Lord our God
        O praise His name forevermore
        For endless days we will sing Your praise
        Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

        He shall return in robes of white
        The blazing sun shall pierce the night
        And I will rise among the saints
        My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

        O praise the name of the Lord our God
        O praise His name forevermore
        For endless days we will sing Your praise
