          <h3>O Come to the Altar</h3>
          Are you hurting and broken within?
          Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
          Jesus is calling.
          Have you come to the end of yourself?
          do you thirst for a drink from the well?
          Jesus is calling.
          <em>x2</em>
          
          O come to, the altar,
          the Father's arms are open wide,
          forgiveness, was bought with,
          the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
          
          Leave behind your regrets and mistakes,
          come today thereâ€™s no reason to wait,
          Jesus is calling.
          Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy,
          from the ashes a new life is born,
          Jesus is calling.
          
          O come to, the altar,
          the Father's arms are open wide,
          forgiveness, was bought with,
          the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
          
          Oh what a Saviour,
          isn't He wonderful,
          sing hallelujah Christ is risen,
          bow down before Him,
          for He is Lord of all,
          sing hallelujah Christ is risen.

          <h3>Defender</h3>
          You go before I know
          That You've even gone to win my war
          You come back with the head of my enemy
          You come back and You call it my victory
          
          You go before I know
          That You've even gone to win my war
          Your love becomes my greatest defense
          It leads me from the dry wilderness
          
          And all I did was praise
          And all I did was worship
          And all I did was bow down
          And all I did was stay still
          
          And hallelujah, You have saved me
            So much better Your way
          And hallelujah, Great Defender
            So much better this way
          
          You know before I do
          Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
          Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
          You restore my faith and hope again
          
          And all I did was praise
          And all I did was worship
          And all I did was bow down
          And all I did was stay still
          
          And hallelujah, You have saved me
            So much better Your way
          And hallelujah, Great Defender
            So much better this way
          <em>x3</em>
          
          When I thought I lost me
          You knew where I left me
          You reintroduced me to Your love
          And You picked up all my pieces
          Put me back together
          You are the defender of my heart
          <em>x2</em>
          
          And hallelujah, You have saved me
            So much better Your way
          And hallelujah, Great Defender
            So much better this way

<h3>How Great Is Our God</h3>
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty,
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see,
How great, how great is our God.

Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son, 
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see, 
How great, how great is our God.

Name above all names, 
Worthy of all praise,
My heart will sing 
How great is our God.
<em>x2</em>

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see,
How great, how great is our God.

<h3>Give Me Jesus</h3>
I don't want anything but You
You're more than every dream come true
All of the things I thought I wanted
Don't come close to knowing You

Now that I'm Yours and You are mine
Our love is the secret that I find
I'll spend forever in the pleasure
I've found looking in Your eyes

Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world

More than silver more than gold
You are the treasure that I hold
Now that I've tasted of Your goodness
Nothing else will satisfy

Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
<em>x2</em>

I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing

Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world

<h3>Be Thou My Vision</h3>
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my soulâ€™s shelter, Thou my high towâ€™r:
Raise Thou me heavâ€™nward, O powâ€™r of my powâ€™r.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, my victâ€™ry won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

<h3>Promises</h3>
God of Abraham
You're the God of covenant
And faithful promises
Time and time again
You have proven
You'll do just what You said

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me


God from age to age
Though the earth may pass away
Your word remains the same
Your history can prove
There's nothing You can't do
You're faithful and true

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

I put my faith in Jesus
My anchor to the ground
My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

<h3>Run to the Father</h3>
   I've carried a burden
   for too long on my own
   I wasn't created
   to bear it alone
   I hear Your invitation
   to let it all go
   I see it now, I'm laying it down
   And I know that I need You

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
  
   You saw my condition,
   had a plan from the start
   Your Son for redemption,
   the price for my heart
   And I don't have a context
   for that kind of love
   I don't understand, I can't comprehend
   All I know is I need You

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

   Oh-oh, oh-oh, again and again and again and again
   Oh-oh, oh-oh,

   My heart has been in Your sights
   Long before my first breath
   Running into Your arms
   Is running to life from death
   And I feel this rush deep in my chest
   Your mercy is calling out
   Just as I am You pull me in
   And I know I need You now

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

Oh-oh, oh-oh, again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, Oh-Oh, Again and Again
