        When everyone needs compassion,
        And love that never fails,
        Let mercy fall on me

        Savior, He can move the mountain,
        My God is mighty to save,
        He is mighty to save
        Forever author of salvation,
        He rose and conquered the grave
        Jesus conquered the grave
         
        So take me as you find me
        All my fears and failures
        Fill my life again
         
        I give my life to follow
        Everything that I'd believe in
        Now i surrender
