        <h3>Living Hope</h3>
        How great the chasm that lay between us
        How high the mountain I could not climb
        In desperation, I turned to heaven
        And spoke Your name into the night
        Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
        Tore through the shadows of my soul
        The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
        Jesus Christ, my living hope

        Who could imagine so great a mercy?
        What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
        The God of ages stepped down from glory
        To wear my sin and bear my shame
        The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
        The King of kings calls me His own
        Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
        Jesus Christ, my living hope

        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain
        There's salvation in Your name
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        <em>x2</em>

        Then came the morning that sealed the promise
        Your buried body began to breathe
        Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
        Declared the grave has no claim on me
        Then came the morning that sealed the promise
        Your buried body began to breathe
        Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
        Declared the grave has no claim on me
        Jesus, Yours is the victory

        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain
        There's salvation in Your name
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        <em>x2</em>

        Jesus Christ, my living hope

          I'll never be more loved than I am right now
          Wasn't holding You up
          So there's nothing I can do to let You down
          It doesn't take a trophy to make You proud
          I'll never be more loved than I am right now

          Going through a storm but I won't go down
          I hear Your voice
          Carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out

          You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
          I’ll never be more loved than I am right now
