        <h3>Living Hope</h3>
        How great the chasm that lay between us
        How high the mountain I could not climb
        In desperation, I turned to heaven
        And spoke Your name into the night
        
        Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
        Tore through the shadows of my soul
        The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        
        Who could imagine so great a mercy?
        What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
        The God of ages stepped down from glory
        To wear my sin and bear my shame
        
        The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
        The King of kings calls me His own
        Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        
        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain
        There's salvation in Your name
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        <em>x2</em>
        
        Then came the morning that sealed the promise
        Your buried body began to breathe
        Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
        Declared the grave has no claim on me
        
        Then came the morning that sealed the promise
        Your buried body began to breathe
        Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
        Declared the grave has no claim on me
        Jesus, Yours is the victory
        
        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain
        There's salvation in Your name
        Jesus Christ, my living hope

              <em>x2</em>
              
              Like a rushing wind
              Jesus breathe within
              Lord have your way
              Lord have your way in me
              
              Like a mighty storm
              Stir within my soul
              Lord have your way
              Lord have your way in me
              <em>x2</em>
              
              I surrender
              I surrender
              I want to know You more
              I want to know You more
              <em>x2</em>
