        <h3>It Is Well</h3>
        When peace like a river attendeth my way,
        When sorrows like sea billows roll,
        Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
        "It is well, it is well with my soul."
        
        It is well  (It is well)
        With my soul  (With my soul)
        It is well, it is well with my soul
        
        Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
        Let this blest assurance control
        That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
        And has shed His own blood for my soul
        
        It is well  (It is well)
        With my soul  (With my soul)
        It is well, it is well with my soul
        
        My sin - O, the bliss of this glorious thought
        My sin - not in part but the whole
        Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
        Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul
        
        It is well  (It is well)
        With my soul  (With my soul)
        It is well, it is well with my soul
        
        And, Lord haste the day when the faith shall be sight
        The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
        The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
        Even so - it is well with my soul
        
        It is well  (It is well)
        With my soul  (With my soul)
        It is well, it is well with my soul

        <h3>How Great Thou Art</h3>
        O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder,
        Consider all the works Thy Hand has made,
        I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
        Thy power through-out the uni-verse dis-played.
        
        Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
        How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
        Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
        How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
        
        When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
        And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
        When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
        And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.
        
        Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
        How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
        Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
        How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
        
        And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
        Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
        That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
        He bled and died to take away my sin.
        
        Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
        How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
        Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
        How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
        
        When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
        And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
        Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
        And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"
        
        Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
        How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
        Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
        How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

        <h3>Be Thou My Vision</h3>
        Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
        Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
        Thou my best thought, by day or by night
        Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
        
        Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
        I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord
        Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
        Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
        
        Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
        Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
        Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tow'r:
        Raise Thou me heav'nward, O pow'r of my pow'r.
        
        Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
        Thou mine inheritance now and always:
        Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
        High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
        
        High King of heaven, my vict'ry won,
        May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
        Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
        Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
        Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

        <h3>How Deep the Father's Love</h3>
        How deep the Father's love for us, 
        how vast beyond all measure
        That he should give his only son, 
        to make a wretch his treasure
        
        How great the pain of searing loss, 
        the Father turned his face away
        As wounds which mar the chosen one, 
        bring many sons to glory
        
        Behold the man upon a cross, 
        my sin upon his shoulders
        Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice 
        call out among the scoffers
        
        It was my sin that held him there 
        until it was accomplished
        His dying breath has brought me life; 
        I know that it is finished
        
        I will not boast in anything: 
        no gifts, no power, no wisdom
        But I will boast in Jesus Christ; 
        his death and resurrection
        
        Why should I gain from his reward? 
        I cannot give an answer
        But this I know with all my heart: 
        his wounds have paid my ransom
