        <h3>The Secret Place</h3>
        Where will you run, my soul
        Where will you go when wells run dry
        When the wind starts to blow
        How you gonna keep this flame alive
        
        In the fading light when night is breaking
        I know You will always be waiting
        You'll always be there
        
        I'm running to the secret place
        Where You are, where You are
        I sing to You of all the ways
        You stole my heart, stole my heart
        Better is a moment that I spend with You
        Than a million other days away
        I'm running, I'm running
        I'm running to the secret place
        
        You are my only hope
        You are the Rock on which I stand
        You will not let me go
        I know that I am safe inside Your hands
        
        In the fading light when night is breaking
        I know You will always be waiting
        You'll always be there
        
        I'm running to the secret place
        Where You are, where You are
        I sing to You of all the ways
        You stole my heart, stole my heart
        Better is a moment that I spend with You
        Than a million other days away
        I'm running, I'm running
        I'm running to the secret place
        
        Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life
        We are satisfied here with You, here with You
        Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored
        We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You
        <em>x2</em>
        
        I'm running to the secret place

        Better is a moment that I spend with You

          Lord I come, I confess

        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        
        Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
        Where grace is found is where You are

        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        
        So teach my song to rise to You
        When temptation comes my way
        And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
        Jesus You're my hope and stay

        For you are raised to life again
        
        You have no rival, You have no equal
