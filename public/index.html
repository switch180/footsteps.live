        <h3>All Hail King Jesus</h3>
        There was a moment when the lights went out
        When death had claimed its victory
        The King of love had given up His life
        The darkest day in history
        
        There on a cross they made for sinners
        For every curse, His blood atoned
        One final breath and it was finished
        But not the end we could have known
        
        For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
        What sacrifice was made, as the Heavens roared
        
        All hail, King Jesus
        All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
        All hail, King Jesus
        All hail the Saviour of the world
        
        There was a moment when the sky lit up
        A flash of light breaking through
        When all was lost He crossed eternity
        The King of life was on the move
        
        For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
        What sacrifice was made, as the Heavens roared
        
        And all hail, King Jesus
        All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
        All hail, King Jesus
        And all hail the Saviour of the world
        <em>repeat</em>
        
        Let every knee, come bow before the King of Kings
        Let every tongue, confess that He is Lord
        Lift up your shout let us join with all of heaven
        Singing Holy (Holy)

        You go before I know

        You come back and You call it my victory

        And hallelujah, You have saved me

        You know before I do
        Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
        Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
        You restore my faith and hope again

        Put me back together
        You are the defender of my heart

        <h3>In Christ Alone</h3>
          In Christ alone my hope is found,
          He is my light my strength my song.
          This cornerstone, this solid ground,
          firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
          what heights of love, what depths of peace,
          when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
          My Comforter my All in All,
          here in the love of Christ I stand.
        
          In Christ alone, who took on flesh
          fullness of God in helpless babe!
          This gift of love and righteousness,
          scorned by the ones he came to save.
          till on that cross where Jesus died,
          the wrath of God was satisfied.
          for every sin on Him was laid;
          here in the death of Christ I live.
        
          There in the ground His body lay,
          Light of the world in darkness slain.
          Then bursting forth in glorious day,
          up from the grave He rose again!
        
          And as He stands in victory,
          sins curse has lost it's grip on me.
          for I am His and He is mine,
          bought with the precious blood of Christ.
          <em>x2</em>
        
          No guilt in life, no fear in death;
          this is the pow'r of Christ in me.
          From life's first cry to final breath,
          Jesus commands my destiny.
        
          No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
          can ever pluck me from His hand,
          till He returns or calls me home;
          here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand

          Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
          Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
          The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son, 
          The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
          
          How great is our God, sing with me,
          How great is our God, and all will see, 
          How great, how great is our God.
