          <h3>Song of Ascent</h3>
          O how high would I climb mountains
          If the mountains were where You hide
          O how far I'd scale the valleys
          If You graced the other side

          O how long have I chased rivers
          From lowly seas to where they rise
          Against the rush of grace descending
          From the source of its supply

          'Cause in the highlands and the heartache
          You're neither more or less inclined
          I would search and stop at nothing
          You're just not that hard to find

          I will praise You on the mountain
          And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
          You're the summit where my feet are
          So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
          No less God within the shadows
          No less faithful when the night leads me astray
          You're the heaven where my heart is
          In the highlands and the heartache all the same

          O how far beneath Your glory
          Does Your kindness extend the path
          From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
          To where You sweep the sinner's past

          O how fast would You come running
          If just to shadow me through the night
          Trace my steps through all my failure
          And walk me out the other side

          For who could dare ascend that mountain
          That valleyed hill called Calvary
          But for the One I call Good Shepherd
          Who like a lamb was slain for me

          I will praise You on the mountain
          And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
          You're the summit where my feet are
          So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
          No less God within the shadows
          No less faithful when the night leads me astray
          You're the heaven where my heart is
          In the highlands and the heartache all the same

          Whatever I walk through, wherever I am
          Your name can move mountains wherever I stand
          And if ever I walk through the valley of death
          I'll sing through the shadows my song of ascent

          Whatever I walk through, wherever I am
          Your name can move mountains wherever I stand
          And if ever I walk through the valley of death
          I'll sing through the shadows my song of ascent, my song of ascent
          My song of ascent

          From the gravest of all valleys
          Come the pastures we call grace
          A mighty river flowing upwards
          From a deep but empty grave

          I will praise You on the mountain
          And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
          You're the summit where my feet are
          So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
          No less God within the shadows
          No less faithful when the night leads me astray
          You're the heaven where my heart is
          In the highlands and the heartache all the same

          <h3>Defender</h3>
        You go before I know
        That You've even gone to win my war
        You come back with the head of my enemy
        You come back and You call it my victory

        You go before I know
        That You've even gone to win my war
        Your love becomes my greatest defense
        It leads me from the dry wilderness

        And all I did was praise
        And all I did was worship
        And all I did was bow down
        And all I did was stay still

        And hallelujah, You have saved me
          So much better Your way
        And hallelujah, Great Defender
          So much better this way

        You know before I do
        Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
        Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
        You restore my faith and hope again

        And all I did was praise
        And all I did was worship
        And all I did was bow down
        And all I did was stay still

        And hallelujah, You have saved me
          So much better Your way
        And hallelujah, Great Defender
          So much better this way
        <em>x2</em>

        When I thought I lost me
        You knew where I left me
        You reintroduced me to Your love
        And You picked up all my pieces
        Put me back together
        You are the defender of my heart
        <em>x3</em>

        And hallelujah, You have saved me
          So much better Your way

          <h3>So Will I</h3>
        God of creation
        There at the start, before the beginning of time
        With no point of reference
        You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light

        And as You speak
        A hundred billion galaxies are born
        In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
        If the stars were made to worship, so will I
        I can see Your heart in everything You've made
        Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
        If creation sings Your praises, so will I

        God of Your promise
        You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
        For once You have spoken
        All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

        And as You speak
        A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
        Evolving in pursuit of what You said
        If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
        I can see Your heart in everything You say
        Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
        If creation still obeys You, so will I

        If the stars were made to worship, so will I
        If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
        If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
        For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
        If the wind goes where You send it, so will I
        If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
        If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
        Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!

        God of salvation
        You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
        On a hill You created
        The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

        And as You speak
        A hundred billion failures disappear
        Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
        If You left the grave behind You, so will I

        I can see Your heart in everything You've done
        Every part designed in a work of art called love
        If You gladly chose surrender, so will I

        I can see Your heart, eight billion different ways
        Every precious one, a child You died to save
        If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

        Like You would again a hundred billion times
        But what measure could amount to Your desire?
        You're the One who never leaves the one behind

          <h3>10,000 Reasons</h3>
        Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        O my soul,
        Worship His holy name.
        Sing like never before,
        O my soul.
        I'll worship Your holy name.

        The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
        It's time to sing Your song again.
        Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
        Let me be singing when the even-ing comes.

        Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        O my soul,
        Worship His holy name.
        Sing like never before,
        O my soul.
        I'll worship Your holy name.

        You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
        Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
        For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
        Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

        Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        O my soul,
        Worship His holy name.
        Sing like never before,
        O my soul.
        I'll worship Your holy name.

        And on that day when my strength is failing,
        The end draws near, and my time has come;
        Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
        Ten thousand years and then for-evermore!

        Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        O my soul,
        Worship His holy name.
        Sing like never before,
        O my soul.
        I'll worship Your holy name.
        <em>x2</em>

        Yes, I will worship Your holy name.
        Lord, I'll worship Your holy name.
