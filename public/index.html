        <h3>Heart of Worship</h3>
          When the music fades all is stripped away
        and I simply come
        Longing just to bring something that's of
        worth that will bless your heart

        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within
        through the way things appear
        you're looking into my heart

        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus

        King of endless worth no one could express
        how much you deserve
        Though I'm weak and poor all I have is
        yours, every single breath

        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within
        through the way things appear
        you're looking into my heart

        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus

        <h3>Broken Vessels</h3>
        All these pieces
        Broken and scattered
        In mercy gathered
        Mended and whole
        But not forsaken
        I've been set free
        I've been set free

        Amazing grace
        How sweet the sound
        That saved a wretch like me
        I once was lost
        But now I am found
        Was blind but now I see

        Oh I can see You now
        Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
        Laying Yourself down
        Raising up the broken to life

        You take our failure
        You take our weakness
        You set Your treasure
        In jars of clay
        So take this heart, Lord
        I'll be Your vessel
        The world to see
        Your life in me

        Amazing grace
        How sweet the sound
        That saved a wretch like me
        I once was lost
        But now I am found
        Was blind but now I see

        Oh I can see You now
        Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
        Laying Yourself down
        Raising up the broken to life

          This cornerstone, this solid ground,
          firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
          what heights of love, what depths of peace,
          when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
          My Comforter my All in All,
          here in the love of Christ I stand.

          In Christ alone, who took on flesh
          fullness of God in helpless babe!
          This gift of love and righteousness,
          scorned by the ones he came to save.
          till on that cross where Jesus died,
          the wrath of God was satisfied.
          for every sin on Him was laid;
          here in the death of Christ I live.

          There in the ground His body lay,
          Light of the world in darkness slain.
          Then bursting forth in glorious day,
          up from the grave He rose again!
          And as He stands in victory,
          sins curse has lost it's grip on me.
          for I am His and He is mine,
          bought with the precious blood of Christ.

          No guilt in life, no fear in death;
          this is the pow'r of Christ in me.
          From life's first cry to final breath,
          Jesus commands my destiny.

          No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
          can ever pluck me from His hand,
          till He returns or calls me home;
          here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand

           I've carried a burden
           for too long on my own
           I wasn't created
           to bear it alone
           I hear Your invitation

           And I know that I need You

           I run to the Father, I fall into grace
           I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

           You saw my condition,
           had a plan from the start
           Your Son for redemption,
           the price for my heart
           And I don't have a context

           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

           My heart has been in Your sights
           Long before my first breath
           Running into Your arms
           Is running to life from death
           And I feel this rush deep in my chest
           Your mercy is calling out
           Just as I am You pull me in
           And I know I need You now

           I run to the Father, I fall into grace
           I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again
