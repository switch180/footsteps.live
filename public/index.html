        <h3>Heart of Worship</h3>
          When the music fades all is stripped away
        and I simply come
        Longing just to bring something that's of
        worth that will bless your heart
        
        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within
        through the way things appear
        you're looking into my heart
        
        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        
        King of endless worth no one could express
        how much you deserve
        Though I'm weak and poor all I have is
        yours, every single breath
        
        I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
        itself is not what you have required
        You search much deeper within
        through the way things appear
        you're looking into my heart
        
        I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus
        I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
        it's all about you, it's all
        about you Jesus

         Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary

        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        All my words fall short
        I got nothing new
        How could I express
        All my gratitude
        
        I could sing these songs
        As I often do
        But every song must end
        And You never do
        
        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much
        But I've nothing else fit for a King
        Except for a heart singing
        Hallelujah, hallelu - jah
        
        I've got one response
        I've got just one move
        With my arms stretched wide
        I will worship You
        
        So I throw up my hands
        And praise You again and again
        'Cause all that I have is a
        Hallelujah, hallelujah
        And I know it's not much

        So come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
        Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a
        lion inside of those lungs
        Get up and praise the Lord
        <em>x3</em>
        
        So I throw up my hands
        Praise You again and again

        I was buried beneath my shame
        Who could carry that kind of weight?
        It was my tomb 'Till I met You
        I was breathing but not alive
        All my failures I tried to hide
        It was my tomb 'Till I met You

        Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
        
        Now Your mercy has saved my soul
        Now Your freedom is all that I know
        The old made new, Jesus, when I met You
        You called my name and I ran out of that grave

        You called my name and I ran out of that grave
        Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
        
        I needed rescue, my sin was heavy
        But chains break at the weight of Your glory
        I needed shelter, I was an orphan
        Now You call me a citizen of Heaven
        When I was broken, You were my healing
        Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
        I have a future, my eyes are open
        'Cause when You called my name
        I ran out of that grave
