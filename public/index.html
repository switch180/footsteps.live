        <h3>Psalm 34</h3>
          I sought the Lord
        And He answered me
        And delivered me
        From every fear
        
        Those who look on Him
        Are radi-ant
        They'll never be ashamed
        They'll never be ashamed
        
        This poor man cried
        And the Lord heard me
        And saved me from
        My enemies
        
        The Son of God
        Surrounds His saints
        He will deliver them
        He will deliver them
        
        Magnify the Lord with me
        Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
        Glorify the Lord with me
        Come ex-alt His name fore-ver
        
        Oh taste and see
        That the Lord is good
        Oh blessed is he
        Who hides in Him
        
        Oh fear the Lord
        Oh all you saints
        He'll give you everything
        He'll give you everything
        
        Magnify the Lord with me
        Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
        Glorify the Lord with me
        Come ex-alt His name fore-ver
        
        Let us bless the Lord
        Every day and night
        Never ending praise
        May our incense rise
        <em>x4</em>
        
        Magnify the Lord with me
        Come ex-alt His name toge-ther

        Oh taste and see

        <h3>The Secret Place</h3>
        Where will you run, my soul
        Where will you go when wells run dry
        When the wind starts to blow
        How you gonna keep this flame alive
        
        In the fading light when night is breaking
        I know You will always be waiting
        You'll always be there
        
        I'm running to the secret place
        Where You are, where You are
        I sing to You of all the ways
        You stole my heart, stole my heart
        Better is a moment that I spend with You
        Than a million other days away
        I'm running, I'm running
        I'm running to the secret place
        
        You are my only hope
        You are the Rock on which I stand
        You will not let me go
        I know that I am safe inside Your hands
        
        In the fading light when night is breaking
        I know You will always be waiting
        You'll always be there
        
        I'm running to the secret place
        Where You are, where You are
        I sing to You of all the ways
        You stole my heart, stole my heart
        Better is a moment that I spend with You
        Than a million other days away
        I'm running, I'm running
        I'm running to the secret place
        
        Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life
        We are satisfied here with You here with You
        Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored
        We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You <em>x2</em>
        
        I'm running to the secret place
        Where You are, where You are

        Better is a moment that I spend with You
        Than a million other days away
        I'm running, I'm running
        I'm running to the secret place

        <h3>What A Beautiful Name</h3>
          You were the Word at the beginning
        One With God the Lord Most High
        Your hidden glory in creation
        Now revealed in You Our Christ
        
        What a beautiful Name it is,

        You didn't want heaven without us
        So Jesus You brought heaven down
        My sin was great, Your love was greater
        What could separate us now
        
        What a wonderful Name it is,
        What a wonderful Name it is
        The Name of Jesus Christ my King

        The Name of Jesus
        
        Death could not hold you, The veil tore before You
        You silenced the boast of sin and grave
        The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
        For you are raised to life again
        
        You have no rival, You have no equal
        Now and forever God You reign
        Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
        Yours is the Name above all names
        
        What a powerful Name it is,
        What a powerful Name it is
        The Name of Jesus Christ my King
        What a powerful Name it is,
        Nothing can stand against

         <h3>All Sufficient Merit</h3>
         All sufficient merit, shining like the sun
         A fortune I inherent by no work I have done
         My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior's cross
         Where all sufficient merit did what I could not
         
         In love He condescended, eternal now in time
         A life without a blemish, the Maker made to die
         The law could never save us, our lawlessness had won
         Until the pure and spotless Lamb had finally come
         
         It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
         Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own
         
         I lay down my garments, any empty boast
         Good works, now all corrupted by the sinful host
         I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus, a crimson robe made white
         No more fear of judgement, His righteousness is mine
         
         It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
         Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own

         All sufficient merit, firm in life and death
         The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
         When I stand accepted before the throne of God
         I'll gaze upon my Jesus, and thank Him for the cross
         Yes we thank you for the cross
         
         It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
         Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own

        Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
        Holy, Holy, is He
        Sing a new song, to him who sits on
        Heaven's mercy seat
        
        Holy, Holy, Holy
        Is the Lord God Almighty
        Who was, and is, and is to come
        With all creation I sing

        You are my everything
        And I will adore You…
        
        Clothed in rainbows, of living color
        Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
        Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
        To You the only wise King
        
        Holy, Holy, Holy
        Is the Lord God Almighty

        Jesus your name is power
