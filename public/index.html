          <h3>Living Hope</h3>
          How great the chasm that lay between us
          How high the mountain I could not climb
          In desperation, I turned to heaven
          And spoke Your name into the night
          
          Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
          Tore through the shadows of my soul
          The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
          Jesus Christ, my living hope
          
          Who could imagine so great a mercy?
          What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
          The God of ages stepped down from glory
          To wear my sin and bear my shame
          
          The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
          The King of kings calls me His own
          Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
          Jesus Christ, my living hope
          
          Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
          Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
          You have broken every chain
          There's salvation in Your name
          Jesus Christ, my living hope
          <em>x2</em>
          
          Then came the morning that sealed the promise
          Your buried body began to breathe
          Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
          Declared the grave has no claim on me
          
          Then came the morning that sealed the promise

          Jesus, Yours is the victory
          
          Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free

            Silent night, Holy night
            All is calm all is bright
            Round yon virgin mother and child
            Holy infant so tender and mild
            Sleep in heavenly peace
            sleep in heavenly peace
            
            Silent night, Holy night,
            Shepherds quake at the sight
            Glories stream from heaven afar
            Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
            Christ the Saviour is born
            Christ the Saviour is born
            
            Silent night, Holy night
            Son of God love's pure light
            Radiant beams from thy holy face
            With the dawn of redeeming grace
            Jesus lord at thy birth
            Jesus lord at thy birth

            <h3>O Holy Night</h3>
            Oh holy night
            The stars are brightly shining
            It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
            Long lay the world in sin and error pining
            Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.
            The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
            For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
            
            Fall on your knees
            Oh hear the angel voices
            Oh night divine
            Oh night when Christ was born
            Oh night divine
            Oh night
            Oh night divine
            
            Truly He taught us
            to love one a nother
            His law is love and His gospel is peace
            Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
            And in His name all oppression shall cease
            Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
            Let all within us praise His holy name.
            
            Fall on your knees
            Oh hear the angel voices
            Oh nig-ht divine
            Oh night when Christ was born
            Oh night divine
            Oh night
            Oh night divine

            <h3>God Will Work It Out</h3>
            Before I knew my name,
            before I drew a breath
            He was making ways for me
            Now and everyday, in each and every step
            He is making ways for me
            
            When my heart is full of doubt
            Feels like faith is running out
            I've come too far to turn around
            I know
            
            God will work it out
            God will work it out
            One thing I know
            One thing I’ve found
            God will work it out
            
            Pushing past the fear,
            fighting to relief
            He is making ways for me
            And He won't let me down,
            never ever leave
            He's still making ways for me
            
            When my heart is full of doubt
            Feels like faith is running out
            I've come too far to turn around
            I know
            
            God will work it out
            God will work it out
            One thing I know
            One thing I’ve found
            God will work it out
            <em>x2</em>
            
            Be still my soul
            Be still and know
            Lean in, take hold
            In God alone
            <em>x2</em>
            
            God will work it out
            God will work it out
            One thing I know
            One thing I’ve found
            God will work it out
            
            One thing I know
            One thing I’ve found
            <em>repeat</em>
            God will work it out
            God will work it out
