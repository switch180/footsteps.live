      <h3>Promises</h3>
God of Abraham
You're the God of covenant
And faithful promises
Time and time again

You'll do just what You said

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

God from age to age
Though the earth may pass away

There's nothing You can't do
You're faithful and true

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

I put my faith in Jesus
My anchor to the ground
My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down

      <h3>All Hail King Jesus</h3>
There was a moment when the lights went out
When death had claimed its victory
The King of love had given up His life
The darkest day in history

There on a cross they made for sinners
For every curse, His blood atoned
One final breath and it was finished
But not the end we could have known

For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made, as the Heavens roared

All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world

There was a moment when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through
When all was lost He crossed eternity
The King of life was on the move

For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made, as the Heavens roared

And all hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
And all hail the Savior of the world
<em>repeat</em>

Let every knee, come bow before the King of Kings
Let every tongue, confess that He is Lord
Lift up your shout, let us join with all of Heaven
Singing Holy

Holy
<em>repeat</em>

      <h3>Touch of Heaven</h3>
      How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing

Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Woooh, Woooh
<em>x2</em>

You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
Or the life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all

Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Woooh, Woooh
<em>x2</em>

I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
<em>x3</em>

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

      <h3>Moments</h3>
      Lookin back on the moments
      When I was far from you
      I let the world make me believe I was lost
      Lookin back on the moments
      I thought I’d never see
      I took the pain I felt and pushed it down inside
      I tried to hide

      Cause you saved me from the fire
      Brought me closer to you
      I don’t have all the answers
      When I crumble God

           But I know you’ll be there too
           But I know you’ll be there too

      Lookin back on the struggle
      In the lion’s den
      I felt the goodness of the Lord surround
      Lookin back on the moments
      When I was on my knees
      You gave me peace inside and told me not to cry
      Said it’ll be alright

      Cause you saved me from the fire
      Brought me closer to you
      I don’t have all the answers
      When I crumble God
           But I know you’ll be there too
           But I know you’ll be there too
      You’ll never let me go
      So I’ll sing with all I know
<em>x4</em>

      You saved me from the fire
      Brought me closer to you
      I don’t have all the answers
      When I crumble God
           But I know you’ll be there too
           But I know you’ll be there too

      <h3>Hosanna</h3>
      I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
<em>x2</em>

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
<em>x2</em>

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity
<em>x2</em>

Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

      <h3>King of Kings</h3>
      In the darkness We were waiting
    Without hope Without light
    Till from heaven You came running
    There was mercy in Your eyes
    To fulfill the law and prophets
    To a virgin came the Word
    From a throne of endless glory
    To a cradle in the dirt

    Praise the Father, praise the Son
    Praise the Spirit three in one
    God of glory, majesty
    Praise forever to the King of Kings

    To reveal the kingdom coming
    And to reconcile the lost
    To redeem the whole creation
    You did not despise the cross
    For even in your suffering
    You saw to the other side
    Knowing this was our salvation
    Jesus for our sake you died

    Praise the Father, praise the Son
    Praise the Spirit three in one
    God of glory, majesty
    Praise forever to the King of Kings

    And the morning that You rose
    All of heaven held its breath
    Till that stone was moved for good
    For the Lamb had conquered death
    And the dead rose from their tombs
    And the angels stood in awe
    For the souls of all who'd come
    To the Father are restored
    And the church of Christ was born
    Then the Spirit lit the flame
    Now this gospel truth of old
    Shall not kneel, shall not faint
    By His blood and in His name
    In His freedom I am free
    For the love of Jesus Christ
    Who has resurrected me

    Praise the Father, praise the Son
    Praise the Spirit three in one
    God of glory, majesty
    Praise forever to the King of Kings
    <em>x2</em>

      <h3>Goodness of God</h3>
    I love You, Lord
    For Your mercy never fails me
    All my days, I've been held in Your hands
    From the moment that I wake up
    Till I lay my head
    I will sing of the goodness of God

    All my life You have been faithful
    All my life You have been so, so good
    With every breath that I am able
    I will sing of the goodness of God

    I love Your voice
    You have led me through the fire
    In darkest night You are close like no other
    I've known You as a Father
    I've known You as a Friend
    And I have lived in the goodness of God

    And all my life You have been faithful
    And all my life You have been so, so good
    With every breath that I am able
    I will sing of the goodness of God

    Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
    Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
    With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
    I give You everything
    Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
    <em>x2</em>

    All my life You have been faithful
    All my life You have been so, so good
    With every breath that I am able
    I will sing of the goodness of God
    <em>x2</em>

    I will sing of the goodness of God

      <h3>The Stand</h3>
    You stood before creation
    Eternity in Your hand
    You spoke the earth into motion
    My soul now to stand

    You stood before my failure
    And carried the cross for my shame
    My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
    My soul now to stand

    So what can I say
    And what could I do
    But offer this heart, O God
    Completely to You

    So I'll walk upon salvation
    Your Spirit alive in me
    This life to declare Your promise
    My soul now to stand

    So what can I say
    And what could I do
    But offer this heart, O God
    Completely to you

    So I'll stand
    With arms high and heart abandoned
    In awe of the One who gave it all
    I'll stand
    My soul Lord to You surrendered
    All I am is Yours
