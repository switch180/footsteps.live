        <h3>Lord I Need You</h3>
          Lord I come, I confess
        Bowing here I find my rest
        Without You, I fall apart
        You're the one that guides my heart
        
        Lord, I need You, oh I need You
        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        
        Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
        Where grace is found is where You are
        And where You are Lord I am free
        Holiness is Christ in me
        
        Lord, I need You, oh I need You
        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        
        So teach my song to rise to You
        When temptation comes my way
        And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
        Jesus You're my hope and stay
        Jesus You're my hope and stay
        <em>x2</em>
        
        Lord, I need You, oh I need You
        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        Lord, I need You, oh I need You
        Every hour I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You
        My one defense, my righteousness
        Oh God, how I need You

        <h3>Run to the Father</h3>
           I've carried a burden
           for too long on my own
           I wasn't created
           to bear it alone
           I hear Your invitation
           to let it all go
           I see it now, I'm laying it down
           And I know that I need You
        
           I run to the Father, I fall into grace
           I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
        
           Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
          
           You saw my condition,
           had a plan from the start
           Your Son for redemption,
           the price for my heart
           And I don't have a context
           for that kind of love
           I don't understand, I can't comprehend
           All I know is I need You
        
           I run to the Father, I fall into grace
           I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
        
           Oh-oh, oh-oh, again and again and again and again
           Oh-oh, oh-oh,
        
           My heart has been in Your sights
           Long before my first breath
           Running into Your arms
           Is running to life from death
           And I feel this rush deep in my chest
           Your mercy is calling out
           Just as I am You pull me in
           And I know I need You now
        
           I run to the Father, I fall into grace
           I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
           My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
           So I'll run to the Father again and again

        You call me out upon the waters
        The great unknown where feet may fail
        And there I find You in the mystery
        In oceans deep my faith will stand
        
        And I will call upon Your Name
        And keep my eyes above the waves
        When oceans rise
        My soul will rest in Your embrace
        For I am Yours and You are mine
        
        Your grace abounds in deepest waters
        Your sovereign hand will be my guide
        Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
        You've never failed and You won't start now
        
        And I will call upon Your Name
        And keep my eyes above the waves
        When oceans rise
        My soul will rest in Your embrace
        For I am Yours and You are mine
        
        Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
        Let me walk upon the waters
        Wherever You would call me
        Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
        And my faith will be made stronger
        In the presence of my Saviour
        <em>x3</em>
        
        And I will call upon Your Name
        And keep my eyes above the waves

        <h3>Come Thou Fount</h3>
        Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
        Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
        Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
        Call for songs of loudest praise.
        
        Teach me some melodious sonnet,
        Sung by flaming tongues above;
        Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
        Mount of Thy redeeming love.
        
        Here I raise my "Ebenezer";
        Hither by Thy help I'm come;
        And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
        Safely to arrive at home.
        
        Jesus sought me when a stranger,
        Wandering from the fold of God;
        He, to rescue me from danger,
        Interposed His precious blood.
        
        Oh, to grace how great a debtor,
        Daily I'm constrained to be!
        Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
        Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
        
        Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
        Prone to leave the God I love;
        Here's my heart, take and seal it,
        Seal it for Thy courts above.
        
        Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
        Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
        Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
        Call for songs of loudest praise.
        
        Teach me some melodious sonnet,
        Sung by flaming tongues above;

        <h3>How He Loves</h3>
        He is jealous for me
        Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
        Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
        
        When all of a sudden,
        I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
        And I realize just how beautiful You are,

        Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes

        And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
        And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
        I don't have time to maintain these regrets
        When I think about the way

        <h3>Living Hope</h3>
        How great the chasm that lay between us
        How high the mountain I could not climb
        In desperation, I turned to heaven
        And spoke Your name into the night
        Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
        Tore through the shadows of my soul

        Who could imagine so great a mercy?
        What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
        The God of ages stepped down from glory
        To wear my sin and bear my shame
        The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
        The King of kings calls me His own
        Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
        Jesus Christ, my living hope
        
        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free

        Then came the morning that sealed the promise
        Your buried body began to breathe
        Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
        Declared the grave has no claim on me
        Jesus, Yours is the victory
        
        Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
        Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
        You have broken every chain
