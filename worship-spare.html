From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son

Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?

He is! He is! He is! He is!
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
He is!
He is

  <h3>How He Loves</h3>
He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me

Ohhhh He loves us so
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves us

He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me

Oh He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves

And we are His portion and He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking
And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way

Oh He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves

  <h3>King of Kings</h3>
  In the darkness We were waiting
Without hope Without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel
Shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

  <h3>Living Hope</h3>
How great the chasm that lay between us
How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Jesus, Yours is the victory

Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There's salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Jesus Christ, my living hope

  So there's nothing I can do to let You down
  It doesn't take a trophy to make You proud

<h3>Man of Sorrows</h3>
Man of sorrows Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

Oh that rugged cross
My salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out
Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

Sent of heaven God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

Oh that rugged cross
My salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out
Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
O is free indeed

Oh that rugged cross
My salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out
Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee
<em>x2</em>

See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised
He's risen from the grave

Oh that rugged cross
My salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out
Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

Praise and honour unto Thee

<h3>O Praise the Name</h3>
I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled and died for me
I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
My Saviour on that cursed tree

His body bound and drenched in tears
They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

O praise the name of the Lord our God
O praise His name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

And then on the third at break of dawn
The Son of heaven rose again
O trampled death where is your sting?
The angels roar for Christ the King

O praise the name of the Lord our God
O praise His name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

He shall return in robes of white
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
And I will rise among the saints
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face

O praise the name of the Lord our God
O praise His name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

O praise the name of the Lord our God
O praise His name forevermore
For endless days we will sing Your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

  <h3>Christ Be Magnified</h3>
  Were creation suddenly articulate
With a thousand tongues to lift one cry
Then from north to south and east to west
We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'

Were the whole earth echoing His eminence
His name would burst from sea and sky
From rivers to the mountain tops
We'd hear 'Christ be magnified!'

O! Christ be magnified!
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me
O! Christ be magnified!
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me
<em>x2</em>

When every creature finds its inmost melody
And every human heart its native cry
O then in one enraptured hymn of praise
We'll sing 'Christ be magnified!'


O! Christ be magnified!
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me
O! Christ be magnified!
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me
<em>x2</em>

I won't bow to idols,
I'll stand strong and worship You
And if it puts me in the fire,
I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too
I won't be formed by feelings,
I hold fast to what is true
If the cross brings transformation
then I'll be crucified with You
'Cause death is just the doorway
into resurrection life
And if I join You in Your suffering
then I'll join You when You rise
And when You return in glory
with all the angels and the saints
My heart will still be singing
and my song will be the same

O! Christ be magnified!
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me
O! Christ be magnified!
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

  <h3>You’re Beautiful</h3>
  I see Your face in every sunrise
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say
You’re beautiful
You’re beautiful

I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies

We are amazed in the light of the stars
It’s all proclaiming who You are
You’re beautiful, You're beautiful

I see you there hanging on a tree
You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me
Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home
You’re beautiful, You're beautiful

When we arrive at eternity’s shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are
no more
We’ll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we’ll sing
You’re beautiful, You're beautiful

I see Your face, You're beautiful, You're
beautiful, You're beautiful
I see Your face, You're beautiful, You're

  <h3>Heart of Worship</h3>
  When the music fades all is stripped away
and I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of
worth that will bless your heart

I'll bring you more than a song for a song in

about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when

how much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor all I have is

Death could not hold you, The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring, the praise of Yourglory
For you are raised to life again

You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names

What a powerful Name it is,
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is,
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is,
The Name of Jesus
<em>x2</em>

What a powerful Name it is,
The Name of Jesus
What a powerful Name it is,
The Name of Jesus
I Surrender

  <h3>Psalm 34</h3>
  I sought the Lord
And He answered me
And delivered me
From every fear

Those who look on Him
Are radi-ant
They'll never be ashamed
They'll never be ashamed

This poor man cried
And the Lord heard me
And saved me from
My enemies

The Son of God
Surrounds His saints
He will deliver them
He will deliver them

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
Oh blessed is he
Who hides in Him

Oh fear the Lord
Oh all you saints
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never ending praise
May our incense rise
<em>x4</em>

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything

  <h3>Million Little Miracles</h3>
  All my life, I've been carried by grace
Don't ask me how, 'cause I can't explain
It's nothing short of a miracle, I'm here

I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
I've got some scars, but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle, I'm here

I think it over and it doesn't add up
I know it comes from above

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all
<em>x2</em>

You held me steady so I wouldn't give up
You opened doors that nobody can shut
I hope I never get over what You've done

I wanna live with an open heart
I wanna live like I know who You are
I hope I never get over what You've done

It's not coincidence and it's not luck
I know it comes from above

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all
<em>x2</em>

I can't even, I can't even count them all
I can't even, I can't even count them all
I can't even, I can't even count them all
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all

  <h3>Lord I Need You</h3>
  Lord I come, I   confess
Bowing here   I find my rest
Without You, I fall  apart
You're the one   that guides my heart

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are Lord I am  free
Holiness   is Christ in me

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus You're my hope and stay
<em>x2</em>

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
