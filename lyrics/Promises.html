  <h3>Promises</h3>
God of Abraham
You're the God of covenant
And faithful promises
Time and time again
You have proven
You'll do just what You said

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

God from age to age
Though the earth may pass away
Your word remains the same
Your history can prove
There's nothing You can't do
You're faithful and true

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast
And let my heart learn when You speak a word
It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me

I put my faith in Jesus
My anchor to the ground
My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down
<em>x3</em>

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me
From the rising sun to the setting same
I will praise Your name
Great is Your faithfulness to me
<em>x3</em>
