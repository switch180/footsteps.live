  <h3>Million Little Miracles</h3>
  All my life, I've been carried by grace
Don't ask me how, 'cause I can't explain
It's nothing short of a miracle, I'm here

I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
I've got some scars, but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle, I'm here

I think it over and it doesn't add up
I know it comes from above

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all
<em>x2</em>

You held me steady so I wouldn't give up
You opened doors that nobody can shut
I hope I never get over what You've done

I wanna live with an open heart
I wanna live like I know who You are
I hope I never get over what You've done

It's not coincidence and it's not luck
I know it comes from above

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all
<em>x2</em>

I can't even, I can't even count them all
I can't even, I can't even count them all
I can't even, I can't even count them all
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all

I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all
<em>x3</em>
