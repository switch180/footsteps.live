<h3>The First Noel</h3>
The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor
Shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel Noel, Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Noel Noel, Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Noel Noel, Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Noel Noel, Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heav'n and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Noel Noel, Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel.
