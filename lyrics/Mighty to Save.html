<h3>Mighty to Save</h3>
When everyone needs compassion,
And love that never fails,
Let mercy fall on me

When everyone needs forgiveness,
Kindness of the Savior
The Hope of the nation

Savior, He can move the mountain,
My God is mighty to save,
He is mighty to save
Forever author of salvation,
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
 
So take me as you find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
 
I give my life to follow
Everything that I'd believe in
Now i surrender
 
Savior, He can move the mountain,
My God is mighty to save,
He is mighty to save
Forever author of salvation,
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

Shine a light in and let the whole world see
Singing, for the glory of the risen king
Jesus, Shine a light and let the whole world see
Singing for the glory of the risen king
