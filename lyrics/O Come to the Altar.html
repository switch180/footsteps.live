<h3>O Come to the Altar</h3>
Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling.
Have you come to the end of yourself?
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling.

O come to, the altar,
the Father's arms are open wide,
forgiveness, was bought with,
the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes,
come today thereâ€™s no reason to wait,
Jesus is calling.
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy,
from the ashes a new life is born,
Jesus is calling.

O come to, the altar,
the Father's arms are open wide,
forgiveness, was bought with,
the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

Oh what a Savior,
isn't He wonderful,
sing hallelujah Christ is risen,
bow down before Him,
for He is Lord of all,
sing hallelujah Christ is risen.

O come to, the altar,
the Father's arms are open wide,
forgiveness, was bought with,
the precious blood of Jesus.

Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found
