<h3>Jesus at the Center</h3>
  Jesus at the center of it all
Jesus at the center of it all
From beginning to the end
It will always be
It's always been You, Jesus, Jesus

Jesus at the center of it all
Jesus at the center of it all
From beginning to the end
It will always be
It's always been You, Jesus, Jesus

And nothing else matters
Nothing in this world will do
Jesus, You're the center
Everything revolves around You
Jesus, Itâ€™s you

Jesus, be the center of my life
Jesus, be the center of my life
From beginning to the end
It will always be
It's always been You, Jesus, Jesus

And nothing else matters
Nothing in this world will do
Jesus, You're the center
Everything revolves around You

And nothing else matters
Nothing in this world will do
Jesus, You're the center
Everything revolves around You
Jesus, It's you

From my heart to the heavens, Jesus be the center
It's all about You, yes, it's all about You
<em>x4</em>

Jesus, be the center of Your church
Jesus, be the center of Your church
And ev'ry knee will bow
And ev'ry tongue shall confess You
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
