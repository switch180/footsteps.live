<h3>I Surrender</h3>
Here I am
Down on my knees again
Surrendering all
Surrendering all

Find me here
Lord as You draw me near
Desperate for You
Desperate for You
I Surrender

Drench my soul
As mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst

With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now
Speak to me now

I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
<em>x2</em>

Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have your way
Lord have your way in me

Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have your way
Lord have your way in me
<em>x2</em>

I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
<em>x2</em>
