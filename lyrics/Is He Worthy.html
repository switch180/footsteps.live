<h3>Is He Worthy</h3>
  Do you feel the world is broken?
  <span class="fw-bolder">We do</span>
Do you feel the shadows deepen?
<span class="fw-bolder">We do</span>
But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through?
<span class="fw-bolder">We do</span>
Do you wish that you could see it all made new?
<span class="fw-bolder">We do</span>

Is all creation groaning?
<span class="fw-bolder">It is</span>
Is a new creation coming?
<span class="fw-bolder">It is</span>
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst?
<span class="fw-bolder">It is</span>
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this?
<span class="fw-bolder">It is</span>

Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave

Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
<span class="fw-bolder">He is</span>

Does the Father truly love us?
<span class="fw-bolder">He does</span>
Does the Spirit move among us?
<span class="fw-bolder">He does</span>
And does Jesus, our Messiah hold forever those He loves?
<span class="fw-bolder">He does</span>
Does our God intend to dwell again with us?
<span class="fw-bolder">He does</span>

Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son

Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?

He is! He is! He is! He is!
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
He is!
He is
