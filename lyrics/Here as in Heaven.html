  <h3>Here as in Heaven</h3>
  The atmosphere is changing now
For the Spirit of the Lord is here
The evidence is all around
That the Spirit of the Lord is here

The atmosphere is changing now
For the Spirit of the Lord is here
The evidence is all around
That the Spirit of the Lord is here

Overflow in this place,
Fill our hearts with your love
Your love, surrounds us
Youâ€™re the reason we came,
To encounter your love
Your love, surrounds us

Spirit of God fall fresh on us
We need your presence
Your kingdom come, your will be done
Here as in heaven

Spirit of God fall fresh on us
We need your presence
Your kingdom come, your will be done
Here as in heaven

Spirit of God fall fresh on us
We need your presence
Your kingdom come, your will be done
Here as in heaven

A miracle can happen now
For the Spirit of the Lord is here
The evidence is all around
That the Spirit of the Lord is here

A miracle can happen now
For the Spirit of the Lord is here
The evidence is all around
That the Spirit of the Lord is here
