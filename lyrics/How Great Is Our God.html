<h3>How Great Is Our God</h3>
The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty,
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see,
How great, how great is our God.

Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son, 
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see, 
How great, how great is our God.

Name above all names, 
Worthy of all praise,
My heart will sing 
How great is our God.
<em>x2</em>

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, and all will see,
How great, how great is our God.
