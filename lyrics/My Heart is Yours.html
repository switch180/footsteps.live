<h3>My Heart is Yours</h3>
I give You my life
I give You my trust
Jesus
You are my God
You are enough

Jesus

My heart is Yours
My heart is Yours
Take it all, take it all
My life in Your hands
<em>x2</em>

I lay down my life
I take up my cross
Jesus 
You are my God
Whatever the cost
Jesus
Oh, Jesus

My heart is Yours
My heart is Yours
Take it all, take it all
My life in Your hands
<em>x2</em>

All to Jesus I surrender
All to You I freely give
Oh, I will ever
Love and trust You
In Your presence
I will live
<em>x2</em>

My heart is Yours
My heart is Yours
Take it all, take it all
My life in Your hands
<em>x3</em>

You can take it all, take it all
My life in Your hands
