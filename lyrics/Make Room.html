<h3>Make Room</h3>
Here is where I lay it down
Every burden, every crown
This is my surrender
This is my surrender
Here is where I lay it down
Every lie and every doubt
This is my surrender

And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to
And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to

Here is where I lay it down
Every burden, every crown
This is my surrender
This is my surrender
Here is where I lay it down
Every lie and every doubt
This is my surrender

And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to
And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to
<em>x2</em>

Shake up the ground of all my tradition
Break down the walls of all my religion
Your way is better
Oh Your way is better
<em>x3</em>

And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to
<em>x3</em>

Here is where I lay it down
You are all I'm chasing now
This is my surrender
This is my surrender
Here is where I lay it down
You are all I'm chasing now
This is my surrender
This is my surrender
