<h3>How Deep the Father’s Love</h3>
How deep the Father's love for us, 
how vast beyond all measure
That he should give his only son, 
to make a wretch his treasure

How great the pain of searing loss, 
the Father turned his face away
As wounds which mar the chosen one, 
bring many sons to glory

Behold the man upon a cross, 
my sin upon his shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice 
call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held him there 
until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life; 
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything: 
no gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ; 
his death and resurrection

Why should I gain from his reward? 
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart: 
his wounds have paid my ransom
