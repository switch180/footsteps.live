<h3>God Will Work It Out</h3>
Before I knew my name,
before I drew a breath
He was making ways for me
Now and everyday, in each and every step
He is making ways for me

When my heart is full of doubt
Feels like faith is running out
I've come too far to turn around
I know

God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I’ve found
God will work it out

Pushing past the fear,
fighting to relief
He is making ways for me
And He won't let me down,
never ever leave
He's still making ways for me

When my heart is full of doubt
Feels like faith is running out
I've come too far to turn around
I know

God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I’ve found
God will work it out
<em>x2</em>

Be still my soul
Be still and know
Lean in, take hold
In God alone
<em>x2</em>

God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing I’ve found
God will work it out

One thing I know
One thing I’ve found
<em>repeat</em>
God will work it out
God will work it out
