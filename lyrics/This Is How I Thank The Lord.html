<h3>This is How I thank the Lord</h3>
I don't have enough words
I'll never live enough lifetimes
To fully know Your worth
To know all that You deserve
All of my deceptions
All of my duplicity
Now there is no record
You assume the best of me

And this is why I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak   So I will sing
This is why I thank the Lord for everything
And this is why I thank the Lord
All of my affection 
Everything I have to give
The sum of my attention
Is measured in the praise I lift 
So this is how I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
     
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord
Yeah, this is how I thank the Lord for loving me
And keeping me

So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord

I will sing
I will sing
I will lift my praises to You
<em>x3</em>

I will sing
I will sing
'Cause this is how I praise the Lord

This is how I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord 
<em>x2</em>

This is how I thank the Lord
This is how I thank the Lord
This is how I thank the Lord
This is how I thank the Lord
  <em>x2</em>
