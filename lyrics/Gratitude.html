<h3>Gratitude</h3>
All my words fall short
I got nothing new
How could I express
All my gratitude

I could sing these songs
As I often do
But every song must end
And You never do

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I've got one response
I've got just one move
With my arms stretched wide
I will worship You

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

So come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a
lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord
<em>x3</em>

So I throw up my hands
Praise You again and again

'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King

Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
