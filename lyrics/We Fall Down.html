<h3>We Fall Down</h3>
We fall down, we lay our crown
at the feet of Jesus
The greatness of His mercy and love
at the feet of Jesus

We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lamb

No more fears, You've dried our tears
at the feet of Jesus
Grace abounds to all who've found
the feet of Jesus

We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lamb
