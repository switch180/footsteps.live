<h3>How Great Thou Art</h3>
O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works Thy Hand has made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power through-out the uni-verse dis-played.

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.

When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
