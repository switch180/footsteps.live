<h3>Everlasting God</h3>
Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
<em>x2</em>

Our God, You reign forever
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer
You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint
You won't grow weary

Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
<em>x2</em>

Our God, You reign forever
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer
You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint
You won't grow weary

You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles

Our God, You reign forever
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer
You are the everlasting God

The everlasting God
You do not faint
You won't grow weary
