  <h3>Defender</h3>
You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
You come back with the head of my enemy
You come back and You call it my victory

You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
Your love becomes my greatest defense
It leads me from the dry wilderness

And all I did was praise
And all I did was worship
And all I did was bow down
And all I did was stay still

And hallelujah, You have saved me
  So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
  So much better this way

You know before I do
Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
You restore my faith and hope again

And all I did was praise
And all I did was worship
And all I did was bow down
And all I did was stay still

And hallelujah, You have saved me
  So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
  So much better this way
<em>x2</em>

When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
<em>x3</em>

And hallelujah, You have saved me
  So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
  So much better this way
<em>x2</em>

When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
<em>x3</em>
