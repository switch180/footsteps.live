<h3>How He Loves</h3>
He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me

Ohhhh He loves us so
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves us

He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me

Oh He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves

And we are His portion and He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking
And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way

Oh He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves
