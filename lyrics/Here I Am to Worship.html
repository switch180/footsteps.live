<h3>Here I Am To Worship</h3>
  Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness,
  open my eyes, let me see
  Beauty that made this heart adore you,
  hope of a life spent with you

  And here I am to worship Here I am to bow down
  Here I am to say that you're my God
  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
  altogether wonderful to me

  King of all days O so highly exalted,
  glorious in Heaven a-bove
  Humbly you came to the earth you created,
  all for love's sake became poor

  And here I am to worship Here I am to bow down
  Here I am to say that you're my God
  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
  altogether wonderful to me

  I'll never know how much it cost
  to see my sin upon that cross
  I'll never know how much it cost
  to see my sin upon that cross
  <em>x2</em>

  And here I am to worship Here I am to bow down
  Here I am to say that you're my God
  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
  altogether wonderful to me
  <em>x3</em>
