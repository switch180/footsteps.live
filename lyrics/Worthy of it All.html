<h3>Worthy of it All</h3>
All the saints and angels,
bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns
before the Lamb of God and sing

You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all
From You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory

Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
  <em>x4</em>
