<h3>Had it Not Been the Lord</h3>
Had it not been the Lord who is on our side
Had it not been the Lord who is on our side
The anger of the enemy would have 
swallowed us alive

Had it not been the Lord who is on our side
Blessed be The lord who would not give us up
Blessed be The Lord for His unfailing Love
The snare is broken and we have escaped
Our help is in The name of The Lord
Blessed be The Lord

Had it not been the Lord who is on our side
Had it not been the Lord who is on our side
The water would have engulfed us
We would have surely died
Had it not been the Lord who is on our side

Blessed be The lord who would not give us up
Blessed be The Lord for His unfailing Love
The snare is broken and we have escaped
Our help is in The name of The Lord
Blessed be The Lord

Blessed be The lord who would not give us up
Blessed be The Lord for His unfailing Love
The snare is broken and we have escaped
Our help is in The name of The Lord
Our help is in The name of The Lord
Blessed be The Lord
