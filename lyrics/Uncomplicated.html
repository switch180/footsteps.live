<h3>Uncomplicated</h3>
There's a simplicity, humility
To the way You love me
God, You make it easy

No special words or formulas
Could ever win You over
For Your love is undeserved

Even when I can't see clearly
Somehow You still make it easy

Your love's uncomplicated
You love me just the way I am
So I stand before You
I'm totally surrendered
With open hands and open heart
Jesus have Your way in me

Jesus have Your way in

My brokenness, my loneliness
And the secrets You see
My deepest thoughts, my hidden wars
God, You see right through me

Even when I'm overthinking
Somehow You still love me simply

Your love's uncomplicated
You love me just the way I am
So I stand before You
I'm totally surrendered
With open hands and open heart
Jesus have Your way in me

Jesus have Your way in me

I could sing over and over
I love You
It never grows old
How could I tell You enough
That I love You
I love You, Lord
<em>x3</em>

Your love's uncomplicated
You love me just the way I am
So I stand before You
I'm totally surrendered
With open hands and open heart
Jesus have Your way in me

Jesus have Your way in me
