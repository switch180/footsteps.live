<h3>Sanctuary</h3>
Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living
Sanctuary, for You
<em>x2</em>

It is You Lord, who gave the Savior
heart and soul Lord, to every man
It is You Lord, who knows my weakness
you refine me, with thine own hand

Lead me on Lord, & through temptation
You refine me from within
Fill our hearts with, Your holy spirit
Take all our sins away

Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living
Sanctuary, for You
<em>x2</em>

Lord prepare me, to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living
Sanctuary, for You
Sanctuary, for You
Sanctuary, for You
