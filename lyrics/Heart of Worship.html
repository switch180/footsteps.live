  <h3>Heart of Worship</h3>
  When the music fades all is stripped away
and I simply come
Longing just to bring something that's of
worth that will bless your heart

I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
itself is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
through the way things appear
you're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus

King of endless worth no one could express
how much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor all I have is
yours, every single breath

I'll bring you more than a song for a song in
itself is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
through the way things appear
you're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship and
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made it when
it's all about you, it's all
about you Jesus
