<h3>Undivided Heart</h3>
Prone to wander
Prone to give my heart away
To every anxious thought
To every lesser love
Prone to worry
Prone to doubt you're in control
Of every rise and fall
But You transcend it all

Teach me Your way O Lord, And I will walk in Your truth
Come unite my heart to fear You
All I am is yours, Lord I will praise You
You can have my heart undivided

Prone to wander
Prone to give my heart away
To every anxious thought
To every lesser love
Prone to worry
Prone to doubt you're in control
Of every rise and fall
But You transcend it all

Teach me Your way O Lord, And I will walk in Your truth
Come unite my heart to fear You
All I am is yours, Lord I will praise You
You can have my heart undivided

You are God and I am not
You're God and I am not
You're worthy of my undivided heart
<em>x4</em>

Teach me Your way O Lord, And I will walk in Your truth
Come unite my heart to fear You
All I am is yours, Lord I will praise You
You can have my heart undivided
