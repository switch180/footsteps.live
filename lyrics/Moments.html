  <h3>Moments</h3>
  Lookin back on the moments
  When I was far from you
  I let the world make me believe I was lost
  Lookin back on the moments
  I thought I’d never see
  I took the pain I felt and pushed it down inside
  I tried to hide

  Cause you saved me from the fire
  Brought me closer to you
  I don’t have all the answers
  When I crumble God

       But I know you’ll be there too
       But I know you’ll be there too

  Lookin back on the struggle
  In the lion’s den
  I felt the goodness of the Lord surround
  Lookin back on the moments
  When I was on my knees
  You gave me peace inside and told me not to cry
  Said it’ll be alright

  Cause you saved me from the fire
  Brought me closer to you
  I don’t have all the answers
  When I crumble God
       But I know you’ll be there too
       But I know you’ll be there too
  You’ll never let me go
  So I’ll sing with all I know
<em>x4</em>

  You saved me from the fire
  Brought me closer to you
  I don’t have all the answers
  When I crumble God
       But I know you’ll be there too
       But I know you’ll be there too
  <em>x3</em>
