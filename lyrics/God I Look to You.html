<h3>God I Look to You</h3>

God, I look to You, I won't be overwhelmed
Give me vision to see things like You do
God, I look to You, You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom, You know just what to do
<em>x2</em>

And I will love You, Lord my strength
And I will love You, Lord my shield
And I will love You, Lord, my rock
Forever all my days I will love You, God
<em>x2</em>

Hallelujah our God reigns
Hallelujah our God reigns
Oh, Hallelujah our God (You) (reign)
Forever all my days, Hallelujah
<em>x5</em>
