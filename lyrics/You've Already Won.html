<h3>You've Already Won</h3>
There's A Peace That Outlast Darkness
Hope That's In The Blood
There's A Future Grace That's Mine Today
That Jesus Christ Has Won
So I Can Face Tomorrow
Because Tomorrow In Your Hands
All I Need You Will Provide
Just Like You Always Have

I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won
No Matter What Comes My Way
I Will Overcome
I Don't Know What Your Doing
But I Know What You've Done
I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won

Theres A Mercy In The Waiting
Manna For Today
And When It's Gone I Know Your Not
Your Are My Hope And Stay
And When The Sea Is Raging
Your Spirit Is My '
He'll Fix My Eyes On Jesus Christ
I'll Say That It Is Well
Oh I'll Say That It Is Well

I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won
No Matter What Comes My Way
I Will Overcome
I Don't Know What Your Doing
But I Know What You've Done
I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won

I Know How The Story Ends
We Will Be With You Again
Your My Savior My Defense
No More Fear In Life Or Death
I Know How The Story Ends
<em>x2</em>

I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won
No Matter What Comes My Way
I Will Overcome
I Don't Know What Your Doing
But I Know What You've Done
I'm Fighting A Battle
You've Already Won
