<h3>Tremble</h3>
  Peace, bring it all to peace
The storms surrounding me
Let it break at Your name

Still, call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave at Your name

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Breathe, call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing
Once again, I will praise

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
<em>x2</em>

Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name can-not be over-come
Your name is alive for-ever lifted high
Your name cannot be over-come
<em>x2</em>

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
<em>x2</em>

Jesus, Jesus
