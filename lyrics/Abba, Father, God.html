<h3>Abba, Father, God</h3>
  There’s so much grace,
  How should I then respond?
  It seems that most the time,
  I try to go my own way

  But you never let me go
  You are fightin’ for my soul

  Abba, Father (God) <em>repeat</em>

  And this peace,
  How could I explain
  It seems like every time I lose it
  You’re holdin’ my hand

  Cause you never let me go
  You are fightin for my soul
  Abba, Father (God) <em>repeat</em>

  I will raise a song
  To the healing one
  Lift my eyes up to you
  Cause you have made me new
  <em>x3</em>
