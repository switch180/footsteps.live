<h3>Son Of Suffering</h3>
Oh, the perfect Son of God
In all His innocence
Here walking in the dirt with you and me
He knows what living is
He's acquainted with our grief
A Man of sorrows, Son of suffering

Oh, blood and tears
How can it be?
That there's a God who weeps
There's a God who bleeds
Oh, praise the One
Who would reach for me
Hallelujah to the Son of suffering

Some imagine You
Are distant and removed
But You chased us down in merciful pursuit
To the sinner, You were grace
And the broken You еmbraced
And in the end, thе proof is in Your wounds
Yes, in the end, the proof is in Your wounds

Blood and tears
How can it be?
There's a God who weeps
There's a God who bleeds
Oh, praise the One
Who would reach for me
Hallelujah to the Son of suffering

Your cross, my freedom
Your stripes, my healing
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God in Heaven

Your blood, still speaking
Your love, still reaching
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God forever

Your cross is my freedom
Your stripes are my healing
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God in Heaven

Your blood is still speaking
Your love is still reaching
All praise King Jesus
Glory to God forever
Glory to God forever
Glory to God forever
Glory to God forever
