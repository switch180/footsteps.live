<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
  I sought the Lord
And He answered me
And delivered me
From every fear

Those who look on Him
Are radi-ant
They'll never be ashamed
They'll never be ashamed

This poor man cried
And the Lord heard me
And saved me from
My enemies

The Son of God
Surrounds His saints
He will deliver them
He will deliver them

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
Oh blessed is he
Who hides in Him

Oh fear the Lord
Oh all you saints
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never ending praise
May our incense rise
<em>x4</em>

Magnify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name toge-ther
Glorify the Lord with me
Come ex-alt His name fore-ver

Oh taste and see
That the Lord is good
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything
