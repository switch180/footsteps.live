<h3>Lord I Need You</h3>
  Lord I come, I   confess
Bowing here   I find my rest
Without You, I fall  apart
You're the one   that guides my heart

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are Lord I am  free
Holiness   is Christ in me

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
Jesus You're my hope and stay

Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
Lord, I need You, oh I  need You
Every hour I need You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You

My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
My one  defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need  You
