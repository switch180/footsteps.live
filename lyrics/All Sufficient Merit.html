<h3>All Sufficient Merit</h3>
All sufficient merit, shining like the sun
A fortune I inherent by no work I have done
My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior's cross
Where all sufficient merit did what I could not

In love He condescended, eternal now in time
A life without a blemish, the Maker made to die
The law could never save us, our lawlessness had won
Until the pure and spotless Lamb had finally come

It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own

I lay down my garments, any empty boast
Good works, now all corrupted by the sinful host
I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus, a crimson robe made white
No more fear of judgement, His righteousness is mine

It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own
<em>x2</em>

All sufficient merit, firm in life and death
The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
When I stand accepted before the throne of God
I'll gaze upon my Jesus, and thank Him for the cross
Yes we thank you for the cross

It is done, it is finished, no more debt I owe
Paid in full, all sufficient merit, now my own

All sufficient merit, firm in life and death
The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
