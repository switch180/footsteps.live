  <h3>Build My Life</h3>
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you

Jesus a name above every other name
Jesus the only one that could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you
Oh, we live for you (holy)

Holy there is no one like you
There is none besides you, open up my eyes in wonder
And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
And lead me in your love to those around me

Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you
Oh, we live for you, Jesus
<em>x2</em>

Holy there is no one like you
There is none besides you, open up my eyes in wonder
And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
And lead me in your love to those around me
<em>x2</em>

And I will build my life, upon your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust, in you alone
And I will not be shaken
<em>x2</em>

Holy, there is no one like you
There is none besides you, open up my eyes in wonder
And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
And lead me in your love to those around me
<em>x2</em>

And I will build my life, upon your love
It is a firm foundation
And I will put my trust, in you alone
And I will not be shaken
