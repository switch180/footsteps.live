<h3>Jesus We Love You</h3>
Old things have passed away
Your love has stayed the same
Your constant grace remains the cornerstone
Things that we thought were dead
Are breathing in life again
You cause Your Son to shine on darkest nights

For all that You’ve done
We will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song

Jesus we love You
Oh how we love You
You are the One our
Our hearts adore

The hopeless have found their hope
The orphans now have a home
All that was lost has found its place in You
You lift our weary head
You make us strong instead
You took these rags and made us beautiful

For all that You’ve done
We will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song

Jesus we love You
Oh how we love You
You are the One our
Our hearts adore
<em>x2</em>

Jesus we love You
Oh how we love You
You are the One our
Our hearts adore
Our hearts adore

Our hearts adore
Our hearts adore

Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus
<em>x4</em>

Jesus we love You
Oh how we love You
You are the One our
Our hearts adore
<em>x4</em>
