<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
O come behold the works of God the nations at His feet
He breaks the bow and bends the spear and tells the wars to cease

O Mighty One of Israel You are on our side
We walk by faith in God who burns the chariots with fire

Lord of hosts You’re with us with us in the fire
With us as a Shelter with is in the storm

You will lead us through the fiercest battle
Oh where else would we go but with the Lord of hosts

O God of Jacob fierce and great you lift Your voice to speak
The earth it bows and all the mountains move into the sea

O Lord you know the hearts of men and still You let them live
O God who makes the mountains melt come wrestle us and win
O God who makes the mountains melt come wrestle us and win

Lord of hosts You’re with us with us in the fire
With us as a Shelter with is in the storm

You will lead us through the fiercest battle
Oh where else would we go but with the Lord of hosts

Though oceans roar You are the Lord of all
The One who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still
Though the earth gives way the mountains move into the sea
The nations rage I know my God is in con-trol
<em>x2</em>

Lord of hosts You’re with us with us in the fire
With us as a Shelter with is in the storm

You will lead us through the fiercest battle
Oh where else would we go but with the Lord of hosts
