<h3>Run to the Father</h3>
   I've carried a burden
   for too long on my own
   I wasn't created
   to bear it alone
   I hear Your invitation
   to let it all go
   I see it now, I'm laying it down
   And I know that I need You

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
  
   You saw my condition,
   had a plan from the start
   Your Son for redemption,
   the price for my heart
   And I don't have a context
   for that kind of love
   I don't understand, I can't comprehend
   All I know is I need You

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

   Oh-oh, oh-oh, again and again and again and again
   Oh-oh, oh-oh,

   My heart has been in Your sights
   Long before my first breath
   Running into Your arms
   Is running to life from death
   And I feel this rush deep in my chest
   Your mercy is calling out
   Just as I am You pull me in
   And I know I need You now

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
   I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
   My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
   So I'll run to the Father again and again

   I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart found a surgeon, my soul found a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

Oh-oh, oh-oh, again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh,
