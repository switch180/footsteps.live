<h3>Silent Night</h3>
Silent night, Holy night,
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, Holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born

Silent night, Holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus lord at thy birth
Jesus lord at thy birth

O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.

Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

God of God, Light of Light eternal,
Lo! he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Son of the Father, begotten, not created

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord!

O Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above
Glory to God in the Highest

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
O Jesus! for evermore be Thy name adored.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.
