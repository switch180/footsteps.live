<h3>No Longer Slaves</h3>
  You unravel me with a melody
  You surround me with a song
  Of deliverance from my enemies
  'Til all my fears are gone

  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  <em>x2</em>

  From my mother's womb
  You have chosen me
  Your love has called my name
  I've been born again, into your family
  Your blood flows through my veins

  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  <em>x2</em>

  You split the sea
  So I could walk right through it
  My fears are drowned in perfect love
  You rescued me
  And I will stand and sing
  I am a child of God
  <em>x2</em>

  I am a child of God
  <em>x2</em>

  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  I'm no longer a slave to fear
  I am a child of God
  <em>x2</em>
