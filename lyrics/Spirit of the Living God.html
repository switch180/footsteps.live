  <h3>Spirit of the Living God</h3>
Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We only want to hear Your voice
We're hanging on every word

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We want to know You more and more
We're hanging on every word

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We only want to hear Your voice
We're hanging on every word

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We want to know You more and more
We're hanging on every word

'Cause when You speak and when You move
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

When You come in the room
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We're leaning in to all You are
Everything else can wait

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
Come now and breathe upon our hearts
Come now and have Your way

'Cause when You speak and when You move
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

When You come in the room
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

When You move, You move all our fears
When You move, You move us to tears
<em>x2</em>

When You fall, we fall on our knees
When You fall, we fall at Your feet
And when You fall, we fall on our knees
And when You fall, we fall at Your feet

'Cause when You speak and when You move
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

When You come in the room
When You do what only You can do
It changes us
It changes what we see and what we seek

Spirit of the living God
Spirit of the living God
We only want to hear Your voice
We're hanging on every word
