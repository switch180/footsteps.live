  <h3>Song of Ascent</h3>
  O how high would I climb mountains
  If the mountains were where You hide
  O how far I'd scale the valleys
  If You graced the other side

  O how long have I chased rivers
  From lowly seas to where they rise
  Against the rush of grace descending
  From the source of its supply

  'Cause in the highlands and the heartache
  You're neither more or less inclined
  I would search and stop at nothing
  You're just not that hard to find

  I will praise You on the mountain
  And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
  You're the summit where my feet are
  So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
  No less God within the shadows
  No less faithful when the night leads me astray
  You're the heaven where my heart is
  In the highlands and the heartache all the same

  O how far beneath Your glory
  Does Your kindness extend the path
  From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
  To where You sweep the sinner's past

  O how fast would You come running
  If just to shadow me through the night
  Trace my steps through all my failure
  And walk me out the other side

  For who could dare ascend that mountain
  That valleyed hill called Calvary
  But for the One I call Good Shepherd
  Who like a lamb was slain for me

  I will praise You on the mountain
  And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
  You're the summit where my feet are
  So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
  No less God within the shadows
  No less faithful when the night leads me astray
  You're the heaven where my heart is
  In the highlands and the heartache all the same

  Whatever I walk through, wherever I am
  Your name can move mountains wherever I stand
  And if ever I walk through the valley of death
  I'll sing through the shadows my song of ascent

  Whatever I walk through, wherever I am
  Your name can move mountains wherever I stand
  And if ever I walk through the valley of death
  I'll sing through the shadows my song of ascent, my song of ascent
  My song of ascent

  From the gravest of all valleys
  Come the pastures we call grace
  A mighty river flowing upwards
  From a deep but empty grave

  I will praise You on the mountain
  And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
  You're the summit where my feet are
  So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
  No less God within the shadows
  No less faithful when the night leads me astray
  You're the heaven where my heart is
  In the highlands and the heartache all the same
