<h3>Away in a Manger</h3>
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus, lay down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky,
looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus,
look down from the sky
And stay by my bedside, till morning is nigh.

Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children, in thy tender care
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus,
look down from the sky
And stay by my bedside, till morning is nigh.

Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children, in thy tender care
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.
