  <h3>Worthy Is The Lamb</h3>
  Thank you for the cross, Lord.
Thank you for the price You paid.
Bearing all my sin and shame, in love You came
And gave Amazing Grace.

Thank you for this love, Lord.
Thank you for the nail-pierced hands.
Wash me in Your cleansing flow, now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace.

Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne.
We crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious
High and lifted up
Jesus, Son of God.
The darling of Heaven, crucified
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.

Thank you for the cross, Lord.

Bearing all my sin and shame, in love You came
And gave Amazing Grace.

Thank you for this love, Lord.
And thank you for the nail-pierced hands.
Wash me in Your cleansing flow, now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace

Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne.
We crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious
High and lifted up
Jesus, Son of God.
The darling of Heaven, crucified
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
Worthy is the Lamb.
